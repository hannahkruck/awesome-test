				VISUASYL contains a navigation bar that allows users to switch between the <i>Welcome, Map and Detail page</i>. 
				The tool also offers users various ways to interact with the diagrams. Some charts allows users to show more information by hovering above the diagram or hide some informations 
				by clicking on the legends of an diagram to highlight certain information. Other charts such as the maps offer greater interaction possibilities by allowing users to select filters or parameter settings to obtain specific information, e.g. on a country, citizenship, age or gender. 
				<br>
				The following filtering options for the maps are available to users in the navigation bar:
			<div id=aufzaehlung>
				<ul><li>Switching between the choropleth and line map </li></ul>
				<ul><li>Filtering the map by selecting Age, Gender </li></ul>
				<ul><li>Special filters for the Choropleth Map: Application to target country, Application by country of origin </li></ul>
				<ul><li>Special filters for the  Line Map: Select a Type for Map (Target or Origin Country), Select a specific Country </li></ul>
			</div>
			By adjusting the time slider, users can update the data of the charts to the selected year.

			<p> The visualisation tool was implemented with the open source framework <a target="_blank" href="https://www.streamlit.io"><b> Streamlit</b></a>.<br> 
			Streamlit is both a library and a framework for Python. 
			It allows users to create and publish interactive web apps with a graphical user interface and data visualisation. 
			<br><br>The advantage of Streamlit is that no front-end experience is required and we can create interactive graphical user interfaces and visualisations using only the Python programming language. 
			Probably the strongest point in choosing Streamlit is the time aspect. Because with Streamlit we can invest more time in processing and visualising the data than in dealing with the front end. <br>
			<br>Furthermore, it is possible to integrate various libraries in Streamlit in order to create diagrams.
			For the visualisation of our diagrams and filter options, libraries such as Streamlit, Plotly and Pandas were used:
			<br>
			<div id=aufzaehlung>
				<u>Pandas</u>
					<ul>
						<li>To read CSV files</li>
					</ul>
				<u>Plotly (plotly.graph_objects)</u>
					<ul>
						<li>To create the maps, pie chart, sankey diagram and time graph</li>
					</ul>
				<u>Streamlit</u>
					<ul>
						<li>Create navigation sidebar, sliders, parameter filter and structure of the site</li>
					</ul>
				<u>HTML and CSS</u>
					<ul>
						<li>For user-specific design of the website and the information button</li>
					</ul>

		</p>
		
		<u>Sharing our Visualiszation tool to the public</u>
		<br>Streamlit offers a function called "Streamlit Sharing", which makes it easy to publish our visualisation application. 
		For this, a GitHub account was created by uploading all code files and then linking them to our Streamlit Sharing account. This is another advantage of Streamlit. It allows third parties to use our visualisation tool easily and without further installation.

			<p> In order to have the data in a appropriate format to be displayed in the GUI, 
			the existing data set had to be filtered and adjusted. 
			It was found that it is easiest for the visualization to create a separate pre-processed data set for each visualization form.
			This creates more effort on the side of data pre-processing and data transformations, 
			but makes the visualization in the GUI much easier.  
			<br></br>
			As a first step, it was examined what a suitable CSV file should look like for each visualization form and 
			thereby a data structure was defined. 
			The data is provided in CSV files, since these can be processed well with Python and no database has to be set up.
			<br></br>
			In the given dataset, data without specific classification, such as gender, age, or country of origin, was listed as unknown. 
			For our application, we decided to use only unambiguously assignable data, 
			as this allows a conclusive statement for the given rubric and does not add to the complexity. 
			In addition, it was particularly important for us to remain consistent, so for each of the pre-processed datasets, 
			we explicitly selected males, females, and those under 18, 18-34, 35-64, and over 65. 
			For additional simplicity, we also omitted the distinction between asylum applications and initial applications.
			Furthermore, data for the Overseas Countries and Territories ("Überseeische Länder und Hoheitsgebiete") were removed, 
			since no unique geocode could be determined for this area, which is, however, important for the visualization of the map.
			A period of 10 years (2010 to 2019) was selected as the data for 2020 was not yet complete,

			<p>The visualisation tool <b>visuasyl</b> was developed as part of the module "Visualisation". 
			The aim of this module has been to find a dataset of interest and to develop a visualisation tool. 
			<br>visuasyl was developed by five students (3rd semester) of the Human-Centered Computing programme at Reutlingen University:
			<br>
			<ul>

			<u>Why did we choose this theme and data set?</u><br>
			The issue of refugees and migration has always been an important topic and affects all citizens, whether directly or only indirectly. According to the German Federal Government, more than 70 million people are on the brink of flight worldwide today [1]. 
			Wars, persecution or the financial situation lead people to leave their homeland in order to find a safer and better life.
			We chose this topic and data set to provide information on migration and refugees to interested parties with the help of a visualisation tool.
			<u>What is the purpose of data visualization?</u><br>
			To gain insights from data, it is not enough to look at the raw data. 
			It is usually unstructured and not very useful. It is necessary to analyse the data further so that a conclusion can be drawn from the data. 
			To make this possible from the data set of asylum applications, we have developed a visualisation tool that allows the data to be illustrated with the help of various diagrams. 
			The visualisation of the data makes it possible for the user to recognise patterns or correlations within the data sets.
